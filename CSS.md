# CSS

- Browsers automatically adds some margin and padding to the componenets like the h1 tag. So, it is a good practice to remove it.

- Block Level Elements occupy the entire width that they have available. Also, they create line breaks after and before them.

	Use it:
	```css
	display: block;
	```

 When we use : with a class it's called pseudo class.
 When we use class='btn btn-white' it will add styles from two classes.
